Few automation scripts that I have written to make my work easier.

**file_encrypter.bat -** A Batch Script that encrypts all files in a folder one by one using 7-Zip.

**deauth_wifi.sh -** A Shell Script that does *ping of death* and *deauthentication (both 2.4ghz and 5ghz)* attacks alternatively (to shutout someone playing pubg in room ðŸ˜‰).

**mirror_dir.bat -** A Batch Script that mirrors a directory to my NAS and does incremental backup on consequent runs.

**rename_files.py -** A Python Script to rename all files in a directory.

**git_pusher.py -** A Python Script to git push all files in a directory (one by one).
